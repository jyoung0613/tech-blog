# tech-blog
Build a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. The site is built from scratch and deployed to Heroku. It follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
